        <p>Don't mind the ominous gentleman standing by. He's there for... safety purposes...
        <br>Jokes aside, hello! I am an upcoming Web Developer who only has a Web/CSS-based 
        webpage right now. At the moment, I am undergoing a bootcamp hosted by Northwestern 
        University and EdX. I do have some coding experience, but it has mostly been a hobby 
        to learn rather than a field to specify in until now.
        <br><br>Don't worry! There's lots more coming soon, I promise you. This website, and 
        the available links, are under development as we speak. Just wait and see, or else this 
        gentleman will be... unhappy about your lack of cooperation...</p>
